VIDEO CARD PROBLEMS

Some of the newer accelerated video cards have been reported to cause GP faults with the Deck Daemon for Windows.
To verify if a problem exists between the Daemon, and your video card driver, you need to install the windows original video driver, and rerun the Daemon.  If the problem is solved,  contact your video card manufacturer for updated video drivers.

	To install the windows original video driver:
	    1)  Exit windows completely.
	    2)  Switch to the windows directory (usually  CD\WINDOWS)
	    3)  Run SETUP
	    4)  For Display choose VGA (This is the standard windows driver)
	    5)  After checking to see if the Daemon works, you can re-install the video driver you were 
	         using.

Deck Daemon for Windows makes use of extensive video I/O, and this has caused GP faults with some video card drivers.  This situation is caused by Video Drivers that are not fully compatible with windows I/O and is a know problem with Microsoft corporation.  We make no warranties on these video drivers or there use.

To get updated video drivers from Microsoft:
	
	Microsoft Download Library:	(206) 936-MSDL {6735}

	CompuServe			GO MSL at the system prompt
					Document is WL.TXT
					Search for S13354

Or you can receive the updated driver on disk from Microsoft by calling:  (206) 637-7098

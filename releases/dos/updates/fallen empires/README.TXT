      MULTIPLE ARTIST CARDS

        . Of the 187 cards found in the set, only 102 are differnt in
          function.  The duplication is due to 2, 3 or 4 versions of the
          same cards, but with different artwork offered by different
          authors.  We have number the cards 1, 2, 3 or 4 accordingly.
          Look to the author and the first line of the description to
          determine exactly which card our numbers are referring.

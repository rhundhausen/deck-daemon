   USER'S GUIDE TO RUNNING VIEW.EXE                      JUNE 20, 1995
   ===================================================================

   HOW TO COPY THE FILES

      Assuming that you already have installed or copied your CONJURE
      on DISK or SCRYE on DISK files to your hard drive, you will need
      to copy the files from this diskette as well.  The price guide
      browsing files do not need to be copied to the same directory,
      but we recommend that you do.  Use your Windows FILE MANAGER to
      make directories and/or copy the files from the diskette.  If
      you are using DOS, here's the commands

      C:\> MD C:\SCRYE          <--- Creates the directory C:\SCRYE
      C:\> CD\SCRYE             <--- Changes to that directory
                                     > Insert SCRYE ON DISK.
      C:\SCRYE> COPY A:\*.* /V  <--- Copies SCRYE files from A: drive
                                     > Insert PRICE GUIDE BROWSER DISK.
      C:\SCRYE> COPY A:\*.* /V  <--- Copies BROWSE files from A: drive
      C:\SCRYE> VIEW            <--- Runs the BROWSE program

      You can copy both CONJURE and SCRYE prices to the same directory.
      Please substitute in your own names and disk drive letters to
      customize it for your system.  Other variations of directory
      structures are listed below

   HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

      Type VIEW.EXE at the DOS prompt.  Make sure that you know where
      the CONJURE (*.COD) and/or SCRYE (*.SOD) files are located, since
      you will be asked to enter the path.  Also, make sure that the
      drive that you are running on has at least 500k of available disk
      space, for creation of temporary files.  Here are some command
      line parameters that are available :

         VIEW                : VGA Color Mode
         VIEW [/CGA]         : CGA Color Mode
         VIEW [/BW]          : Black & White (Monochrome)
         VIEW [/MONO]        : Black & White (Monochrome)
         VIEW [?] or [/HELP] : Displays a Syntax Help Screen

   ENTERING THE FILE PATH AND FILE MASK

      If the price guide files are located in the current directory,
      then press enter and use the default path.  If the files are
      stored elsewhere, such as in custom history directories, then you
      can enter that path here instead.  Leave the file mask alone,
      unless you have renamed the files from their original names.

   SELECT A PRICE GUIDE AND CARD GAME

      Once the path has been specified, a listing of the price guide
      files will pop-up for your selection.  Each entry may be an
      entire card game or just one series of a larger card game.  Using
      the arrow keys, select the guide that you wish to browse.  The
      program will then load the appropriate file from disk and allow
      you to browse it.  Note : CONJURE on Disk files will load faster
      than SCRYE on disk files.

   THE BROWSE SCREEN

      The appearance of the browse program will change slightly,
      depending upon the price guide that you are browsing.

      At the bottom of the Conjure on disk price guide browse, you will
      find prices and information about packs, decks, sets and boxes.
      Arrow or page down to the bottom to view this information.  These
      records are noted by their description in the second column.

      The columns may be sorted in one of three (or more) orders.

         CONJURE ORDERS

         Order 1 (Default)   : Column 1 (Series/Set Name)
         Order 2             : Column 2 (Card Name/Description)
         Order 3             : Value    (Medium Value)

         SCRYE ORDERS

         Order 1 (Default)   : Column 1 (Card Name/Description)
         Order 2             : Column 2 (Card Type or Color or Category)
         Order 3             : Value    (Low Value)
         Order 4             : Value    (Medium Value)
         Order 5             : Value    (High Value)

   USING THE BROWSE COMMANDS

         CHANGE THE SORTING ORDER ....................... [O] or [TAB]

         Toggles between sort order 1, 2 and 3.  Your current position
         will be maintained as the sort order changes.

         CARD ZOOM (DISPLAY) .......................... [Z] or [ENTER]

         Pops-up a screen showing all available information about the
         card, set, series, pack or box.  This screen will change
         slightly dependent upon the price guide that you are browsing.

         TEXT SEARCH ............................................. [S]

         Performs a serial search beginning at the next record after
         the currently highlighted one.  Any character or string of
         characters can be searched for in the Game, Series, Card Name
         or Card Value.

         RE-SELECT PRICE GUIDE ................................... [R]

         When you are ready to select a new price guide and/or card
         game, use this command to bring back the original selection
         list that you used when you first ran the program.

         INTERFACE WITH DECK DAEMON .............................. [D]

         This command performs one of three different tasks, based
         upon which price guide you are browsing and what conversions
         you have done.  Here are the three possible options

         INTERFACE USING CONJURE

            Use this command to interface with your Deck Daemon for
            DOS, version 1.2 databases and calculate the worth of your
            cards, sets, decks and entire collection.  You must be
            currently viewing CONJURE'S M:TG price guide.

            First, you must enter the data path where your Deck Daemon
            databases are located.  Typically, this is C:\DAEMON.  You
            will then need to indicate if you are using the Ver 1.2/DOS
            expanded database (Alpha, Beta, Unlimited & Revised).  The
            standard database (M:TG = Unlimited and Revised indicated
            by the "*" in the expansion sets) will be the default.
            You must also select the destination of the report.
            Choices are Screen, File or Printer.

              Screen  : Screen preview.  Use the arrow and page keys.
              File    : ASCII DOS file.  Enter the full path and name.
              Printer : Choose from LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, COM1, COM2

            Next, several steps will be performed : creating temporary
            databases (in your Deck Daemon directory), appending cards,
            appending decks, applying price guide values and generating
            the output.

            Notes

            a) Revised cards (*) have been assigned their Expansion set
               price.
            b) Missing values (n/a) may be user changed/added cards or
               misspellings.
            c) Cards are listed in the first section by series.
            d) Decks are listed in the second section by name.

         INTERFACE USING SCRYE

            Use this command to interface with your Deck Daemon for DOS,
            version 1.2 databases and calculate the worth of your cards,
            sets, decks and entire collection.  You must have already
            converted SCRYE to the .COD format (see next section).

            First, you must enter the data path where your Deck Daemon
            databases are located.  Typically, this is C:\DAEMON.  You
            will then need to indicate if you are using the Ver 1.2/DOS
            expanded database (Alpha, Beta, Unlimited & Revised).  The
            standard database (M:TG = Unlimited and Revised indicated
            by the "*" in the expansion sets) will be the default.  You
            must also select the destination of the report.  Choices are
            Screen, File or Printer.

                 Screen  : Screen preview.  Use the arrow and page keys.
                 File    : ASCII DOS file.  Enter the full path and name.
                 Printer : Choose from LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, COM1, COM2

            Next, several steps will be performed : creating temporary
            databases (in your Deck Daemon directory), appending cards,
            appending decks, applying price guide values and generating
            the output.

            Notes

            a) Revised cards (*) have been assigned their Expansion set
               price.
            b) Missing values (n/a) may be user changed/added cards or
               misspellings.
            c) Cards are listed in the first section by series.
            d) Decks are listed in the second section by name.

         CONVERT SCRYE TO .COD FORMAT

            Use this command to convert all of the M:TG related Scrye on
            Disk files (.SOD) to one .COD formatted file (SCRYE.COD).
            Once the conversion is done, it can be used to interface to
            your Deck Daemon for DOS or Windows version (see above
            section if you are using the DOS version or your user's
            guide if you are using the Windows version.)

            The entire conversion process is automatic.  Each price
            guide that is related to Magic:The Gathering will be read
            and converted and the output file will be generated.  When
            the process is complete a file called CONVERT.REP will be
            generated listing each card and series and remarks stating
            whether the card was found, altered or not found during the
            conversion step.  You should browse this file at sometime to
            verify that all of the series were included in the conversion.

            You may now return to the INTERFACE USING SCRYE section to
            evaluate your Deck Daemon for DOS collection using Scrye's
            price guides.

         QUIT AND EXIT PROGRAM .......................... [Q] or [ESC]

         If you are ready to quit and exit, press the [Y] key.

   PERFORMANCE TIPS

         For best results, copy the VIEW.EXE program and all *.COD
         and/or *.SOD files to your hard drive.  You may copy to any
         directory that you wish.  Although it is possible to run
         VIEW.EXE from the floppy diskette, it isn't recommended that
         you do this.  If you are planning on interfacing with your
         DECK DAEMON databases, then you will definitely want to copy
         files to your hard drive.

   SAVING A HISTORY OF PRICE LISTS

         If you copy the price guide files from your new diskette to
         the same directory each time, you will be overwriting the
         previous price guide files.  To avoid this, you must copy the
         new files to a different directory each time.

         Here is an example of a possible directory structure that
         would save each set of price guide files :

              C:.
              읕컴DAEMON       <--- DECK DAEMON Program & Databases
                  쳐컴COD3     <--- CONJURE on Disk # 3
                  쳐컴COD4     <--- CONJURE on Disk # 4
                  쳐컴COD5     <--- CONJURE on Disk # 5
                  쳐컴SCRYE5   <--- SCRYE on Disk # 5
                  쳐컴SCRYE6   <--- SCRYE on Disk # 6
                  읕컴SCRYE7   <--- SCRYE on Disk # 7

         Use the DOS command (MKDIR) or the Windows (TM) File Manager
         to create the directory structure.  Next, copy all of the
         price guide files and the VIEW.EXE browse program from the
         floppy diskette(s) into the corresponding directory(s).

         You may optionally copy the VIEW.EXE program into a directory
         that has been mentioned in your DOS (PATH) statement.  This
         way you will not need to have multiple copies of the same
         program, and it will also insure that you are always running
         the newest version of the VIEW.EXE program.  Consult your DOS
         reference guide for more assistance.

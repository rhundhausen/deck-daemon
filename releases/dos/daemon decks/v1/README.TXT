                          Release Information 11/21/1994

                            Daemon Decks(TM) Volume 1.0
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   MANUAL ERRATA

     . A sideboard deck is available for OUT OF PLAY, even though it was
       omitted in the user's guide.


   NEW CARD ENTRIES AFTER INSTALL

     . If the Daemon Decks install utility doesn't find a card it needs
       in your inventory of cards, it will add that card and all of the
       related information (color, type, casting cost, artist and the
       description).  Updates to the support tables will also be made.

     . Because of this, you do not need to have an expansion set on your
       computer to load Daemon Decks, even if the new decks contain cards
       from that expansion set.  Sounds confusing eh?

     . If you have changed any of the card names, or if the card names
       have changed due to misspelling corrections in the updates then
       you will get redundant card entries, made automatically during the
       install routine.  Please feel free to use DeckBuilder and/or the
       inventory functions to alleviate these extra cards.

     . To aid you in finding these new cards, all entries will have the
       UPDATE FLAG (see user's guide) set, so you can look for the
       flags to the left of each card.

   INSTALLATION ERRORS

     . To avoid errors when installing from the floppy diskette, be sure
       the diskette is NOT write protected.  Temporary files need to be
       written to the floppy diskette during the installation procedure.
       Flip the small tab DOWN to do this.

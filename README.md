## What Was Deck Daemon?

Historically, Deck Daemon was sold as a PC utility to help Magic players:

- Track their **card collections** (by set, condition, and price)  
- Build and save **decks** using a dedicated deckbuilder  
- Keep card information **up to date** via price lists from *Scrye on Disk* and magazine references

Period sources describe it as:

- A **collection tracker and deck builder** for Magic: The Gathering, version 1.2 selling around \$29.95 in the mid-90s
- A DOS program later supplemented by **Windows versions** (with some gotchas when transferring data between them)
- One of several early **unofficial Magic utilities**, alongside Apprentice, Magic Workstation, CardMaster, etc.
